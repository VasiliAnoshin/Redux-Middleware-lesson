     What is Redux middleware and what are some use cases for it?
    â€¦a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer.
    What's great about middleware is that once it receives the action, it can carry out a number of operations, including:
    <ul>
      <li>producing a side effect (e.g., logging information about the store) </li>
      <li>processing the action itself (e.g., making an asynchronous HTTP request)</li>
      <li>redirecting the action (e.g., to another piece of middleware)</li>
      <li>dispatching supplementary actions</li>
    </ul>
